# Create your first Java Project using jGRASP
```
In this course, we are going to focus on seven learning objectives:

    Using the jGRASP Development Environment to create and compile a class and a main method, as fundamental parts of a Java program. 

    Using single and multi-line comments, and creating integer, double, boolean and, String data types to store values in variables. 

    Display output messages to the screen for the user to see. 

    Accept input from the user in the form of text. 

    Accept input from the user in the form of integers and decimal values. 

    Use the OR operator, a for-loop, and the do-while loop to control the flow of your program. 

    Use the less than, equal, and subtraction operators., and an if-else statement to control the flow of your program.
